    "description": "Adrift in the cosmic expanse so wide, I wander, lost, with no place to reside. Among twinkling stars, I yearn to roam, To find my way back and return to my home.  In the celestial sea, I search for a guide, Through nebulous clouds, my hopes collide. Memories of home, like constellations, shine, Guiding me through darkness, a beacon divine.  Amidst the vastness, I sail, resolute and bold, Chasing starlight, my heart's desire untold. For in that cherished place, love will bestow, And in the embrace of home, I'll finally know."
